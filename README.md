# Wifi_Passwords
The script, named Wifi_Password.py , serves the purpose of displaying the password for the currently connected Wi-Fi network on a Windows PC

Leveraging the subprocess module in Python, it interacts with the Windows command-line utility to extract and present the Wi-Fi password for the active connection.

This can be particularly useful for users who may have forgotten their Wi-Fi password or need to access it for troubleshooting purposes.

The script provides a quick and convenient solution to retrieve the password without the need for navigating through the Windows settings.

Created by [Mir3i], the script is designed to offer a straightforward method for accessing Wi-Fi credentials on a Windows system.
